### Eval Accel-NASBench, Section 5.2 Plots


The file `plot_eval_results.py` generates the plots in Figure 5 of the paper. The script uses hardcoded values of accuracy/latency/throughput from various sources. For FPGA platforms, the existing results are obtained from the Xilinx Vitis AI model zoo [here](https://xilinx.github.io/Vitis-AI/docs/reference/ModelZoo_VAI3.0_Github_web.htm). For TPU and GPU platforms, the throughput were measured using [TIMM Pytorch Image Models](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models). Please see ANB-DatasetCollection for details on throughput measurement.

The plots can be generated by simply running `python3 plot_eval_results.py`.
